	<info>
		<li>Plant material from wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana plants of Columbia-0 ecotype was analyzed.</li>
		<li>Plants were grown individually in soil at 20Â°C, 16/8 hour light/dark conditions.</li>
		<li>After complete growth of rosette, at principle growth stage 3.901 (3-4 weeks after planting), treatment plants were cultured with Myzus persicaere (apterous aphids) using clip cages.</li>
		<li>Leaves were harvested 8 h after infestation and controls and infested treatments were paired according to rosette size and leaf number.</li>
		<li>Three biological replicate were processed.</li>
		<li>RNA was isolated and hybridized to the ATH1 GeneChip.</li>
		<li>The data were normalized by GCOS normalization, TGT 100.</li>
		<li>Results generated by the Pritchard Lab, see Couldridge, C. et al. (2007) Bulletin of Entomological Research 97: 523-553.</li>
